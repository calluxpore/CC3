# Blob Detection in Processing

## Project Overview

This project features a Blob Detection implementation in the Processing programming environment, designed to identify and track blob-like structures within an interactive canvas. It's an excellent demonstration of basic computer vision techniques and object tracking principles using Processing's capabilities.

## Features

- Dynamic Blob Tracking: Able to track the position and size of blobs within the canvas.
- Interactive Visualization: Visualizes the detected blobs with customizable boundaries and center points.
- Efficient Processing: Implements efficient algorithms for real-time blob detection and tracking.
- Extensibility: Easily adaptable code for various interactive and creative projects involving shape or motion detection.
